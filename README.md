# Optimizing-Amtrak's-Efficiency
I’m excited to share a recent milestone from my journey as a Business Intelligence & Data Analyst! Along with my team, I completed a full BI case analysis and dashboard project focused on Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.

**🔍 Project Highlights:**

 ✅ Identified operational challenges like train delays, poor resource allocation, and customer dissatisfaction.
 ✅ Proposed a centralized BI solution using Tableau, SQL, and predictive analytics.
 ✅ Developed interactive dashboards visualizing ridership trends, top-performing routes, and revenue patterns.
 ✅ Built a star schema, unified data sources, and recommended real-time insights for better decision-making.

**📊 Tools Used:** Tableau | Excel | SQL | Data Modeling | Predictive Analytics

📁** Dataset**:Amtrak station-level ridership, route performance, and ticketing trends.

This project helped me deepen my skills in data analysis, Business Intelligence tools, data visualization, and practical implementation of analytics to solve real-world transportation challenges.

🧠 Looking forward to applying these skills in future data-driven roles!
